<h2>White Matter / CSF Regression<a class="headerlink" href="#white-matter-csf-regression" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> The signal changes in the white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) primarily reflect non-neural fluctuations such as scanner instabilities, subject motion and physiological artefacts (e.g. respiration and cardiac effects) (Dagli et al., 1999; Windischberger et al., 2002). These signals are largely independent from BOLD signal fluctuations recorded in gray matter and may introduce temporal coherences and lead to an overestimation of functional connectivity strengths. Effective estimation and correction for these non-neural noises would allow us to exclude such confounding effects.</p>
<p><strong>Calculation:</strong> The mean WM and CSF time series were calculated by averaging signal over all voxels within a WM or a CSF mask for each time point. The mean WM and CSF time series were then used as temporal covariates and removed from the raw data through linear regression.</p>

<h2>CompCor<a class="headerlink" href="#compcor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Noise regions-of-interest (ROI) refers to areas such as white matter (WM) and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) regions in which temporal fluctuations are unlikely to be modulated by neural activity and are primarily a reflection of physiological noise (Behzadi et al., 2007). Based on the assumption that signal from a noise ROI can be used to accurately model physiological fluctuations in gray matter regions, a novel component based noise reduction method (CompCor) was proposed to correct for physiological noise by regressing out principal components from noise ROI (Behzadi et al., 2007). Compared to the average signal from WM and CSF regions (i.e. WM/CSF regression methods), signals captured by principal components derived from these noise ROIs can better account for voxel-specific phase differences in physiological noise due to the potential of principle component analysis in identifying temporal pattern of physiological noise (Tomas et al., 2002). Thus, preprocessing with CompCor can significantly reduce noise from physiological and other sources (Behzadi et al., 2007; Chai et al., 2012).</p>
<p><strong>Calculation:</strong> The first step of CompCor is to determine noise ROIs. There are two methods to determine noise ROIs: the first one uses anatomical data to identify voxels that consist primarily of either WM or CSF and the second one defines a noise ROI as voxels with high temporal standard deviation (tSTD). A principal component analysis (PCA) is then applied to characterize the time series data from the noise ROI. Significant principal components are introduced as covariates in a general linear model (GLM) as an estimate of the physiological noise signal space (Behzadi et al., 2007).</p>

<h2>Global Signal Regression<a class="headerlink" href="#global-signal-regression" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Global signal, the average signal across all voxels in the brain, was assumed to reflect a combination of resting-state fluctuations, physiological noise (e.g. respiratory and cardiac noise), as well as other noises with non-neural origin.  Global signal regression (GSR) is a preprocessing technique for removing the spontaneous BOLD fluctuations common to the whole brain using a general linear model (GLM). Although GSR can possible change the functional connectivity distribution and result in an increase in negative correlations (Murphy et al., 2009; Saad et al., 2012; Weissenbacher et al., 2009), this technique can facilitate the detection of localized neuronal signals and improve the specificity of functional connectivity analysis (Fox et al., 2005; Fox et al., 2009). Thus, GSR remains a common and useful processing maneuver in the rs-fMRI research field.</p>
<p><strong>Calculation:</strong> A global mean defined as the average signal over all voxels for each time point was used as a temporal covariate and regressed out using linear regression.</p>

<h2>Median Angle Correction<a class="headerlink" href="#median-angle-correction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Medial angle correction is a global signal correction approach. It was assumed that the global signal in resting-state fMRI can be viewed as the sum of two components: a component that reflects the intrinsic correlations of resting state fMRI signals between regions and a nuisance component that reflects an additive global signal confound. Unlike global signal regression method which removes both components, medial angle correction can characterize the properties of the global signal and effectively minimize the effects of the additive global signal confound while preserving the desired components.</p>
<p><strong>Calculation:</strong> Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to decompose the resting-state data. A useful metric, the median angle, was then calculated to characterize the spread of the resting-state vectors.  Median angle is computed by taking the inverse cosine of each voxel’s time series vector&#8217;s projection onto the first principal component (i.e. the global mean signal) and then calculating the median over the angles from all the vectors.</p>
<p>If an inverse relation was found between the median angle and the mean BOLD signal amplitude, then an additive signal confound is present. As resting-state data sets with high median angles and low mean BOLD magnitudes are likely to be the least contaminated by an additive global confound (He and Liu, 2011), the inverse relation between median angle and mean BOLD magnitude was used to correct for differences in the additive confound. Specifically, the angular distributions of datasets with small median angles can be shifted to attain a larger target median angle to effectively minimize the effects of the global signal confound. The calculation of target angle for median angle correction is described in He and Liu (2011).</p>

<h2>Motion Correction<a class="headerlink" href="#motion-correction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Signal intensity change can arise from head motion and the motion-related artifacts represent a serious confound in resting state fMRI studies.  Although various devices were used to minimize motion and subjects were particularly instructed to stay as still as they can, cooperative subjects still show displacements of up to a millimetre or so. Head movements of several millimetres are not uncommon, especially in studies of hyperkinetic populations, such as young children, older adults, or patients. Recent studies have shown that motion as small as 0.1 mm can systematically bias both the within and between-group effects of R-fMRI metrics (Power et al., 2011; Satterhwaite et al., 2012; Van Dijk et al., 2012). Thus, motion correction is a crucial preprocessing step for further data analysis.</p>
<p>There are two main approaches to correct head motion: censoring motion confounded time points (i.e. scrubbing) and using general linear model to regress out the motion-related artifact (i.e. regression of motion parameters). Both approaches are implemented in C-PAC and a general description of each method is below.</p>
<p><strong>Scrubbing:</strong> Scrubbing is a volume censoring technique and corrects motion by censoring time points (i.e. volumes) that are likely to be contaminated by head motion and characterized by a sudden and sharp movement (Power et al., 2011).  Two measures were used to identify these contaminated volumes: framewise displacement (FD) and DVARS. These two measures capture the head displacements and the brain-wide BOLD signal displacements from volume to volume overall all voxels within the brain (Power et al., 2011).</p>
<p>FD is calculated from derivatives of the sixe rigid body realignment parameters estimated from the realignment procedure and is a compressed single index of the six realignment parameters. DVARS is the root mean squared (RMS) change in BOLD signal from volume to volume (D referring to temporal derivative of time courses and VARS referring to RMS variance over voxels). DVARS is calculated by first differentiating the volumetric time series and then calculating the RMS signal change overall the whole brain. This measure indexes the change rate of BOLD signal across the entire brain at each frame of data or, in other words, how much the intensity of a brain image changes relative to the previous time point.</p>
<p>After calculating FD and DVARS, thresholds can be applied to censor the data. Selecting thresholds for censoring is a trade-off. More stringent thresholds would allow more fully removal of motion-contaminated data and minimize motion-induced artifacts. Meanwhile, more stringent censoring would also remove more data, which may increase the variability and decrease the test-retest reliability of the data. Commonly used thresholds are FD &gt; 0.2 to 0.5 mm and DVARS &gt; 0.3 to 0.5% BOLD.</p>
<p>Other considerations for this method include: removing time points from the continuous time series can disturb the temporal structure of the data and preclude the data from certain analysis such as frequency-based analysis. However, this method has been shown to be effective in minimizing motion-related artifacts in seed-based correlation analyses (Power et al., 2011; 2012).</p>
<p><strong>Regression Motion Parameters:</strong> This method corrects motion by modeling the impact of motion on the time series and removing the predicted impact of motion from the time series. Specifically, the three translation and three rotation parameters for head movement were estimated by motion realignment procedures and then regressed out from the time series data (Fox et al., 2005; Weissenbacher et al., 2009).</p>
