Spatial Smoothing
-----------------

Why Smooth?
^^^^^^^^^^^

The main goal of smoothing is to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of an image. This is done by removing high-frequency information (assumed to consist mostly of noise) while preserving signals on larger spatial scales (those which stretch across multiple voxels and are of most likely to reflect neuronal activity). Smoothing can also help reduce the effect of anatomical variability when comparing activations between subjects (Poldrack et al., 2011). Additionally, smoothing with a Gaussian kernel (described below) will result in the distribution of signals found in an image more closely match the assumptions of statistical tests often used on fMRI data.

How Smoothing Works
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Smoothing is accomplished by applying a Gaussian filter (also known as a kernel) to the original image. This results in the signal of each voxel being replaced by the weighted average of its neighbors (Ashby, 2011). It is the shape of the kernel that defines the weights applied during smoothing. As a Gaussian kernel is essentially a normal distribution, weight is always strongest at the voxel being smoothed and decreases with distance at a rate that depends on the width of the distribution. Wider distributions result in greater smoothing, as more distant voxels recieve higher weights than they would with a thinner kernel. Unlike in statistics, where the width of a distribution is described by the standard devition, the shape of a smoothing kernel is usually described by the width of the distribution at half of its maximum value. This is known as the Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM). The figure below shows kernels of differint FWHM and the smoothing that results from each.

Smoothing Guidelines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The amount of smoothing applied should be the minimum necessary to achive the desired result. As a general rule, a FWHM of twice the voxel dimension is a good starting point (Poldrack et al., 2011). That being said, different situations will require adjustment of this value. In particular, the FWHM should never be larger than the smallest activation signal you are interested in detecting; any larger value may result in signal loss.

Care must be taken when utilizing methods such as Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) and Multi-voxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA) which are sensitive to the activation of individual voxels, as smoothing prior to analysis may bias results by introducing artificial spatial correlation. In these cases, if smoothing is desired, such as in order to correct for multiple comparisons using Gaussian Random Field Theory, it must be applied after the fact.
