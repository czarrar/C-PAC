Computer Settings
-----------------

runOnGrid
^^^^^^^^^
Specify whether C-PAC will be running on a local machine or a compute cluster (grid). Options are True and False::

	# True = Run on compute cluster
	# False = Run on local machine
	runOnGrid = False

numSubjectsAtOnce
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When running on a local machine that has multiple processing cores, specify how many subjects should be run simultaneously::

	# Number of subjects to run simultaneously
	# This number depends on computing resources
	# Only applies when running on a local machine with multiple cores
	numSubjectsAtOnce = 5

numCoresPerSubject
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When running C-PAC on a grid or local machine with multiple cores, the number of dedicated cores (on a local machine) or slots on a node (on a grid) for each subject::

	# Number of cores (local) or slots on a node (cluster) per subject
	# Slots are cores on a cluster node
	# This number depends on computing resources
	# Only applies when local machine has multiple cores or runOnGrid = True
	numCoresPerSubject = 2

SGE Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^
When running on a cluster with SGE, the user must properly configure their SGE environment. Instructions for doing so are available in the configuration file.

queue
"""""
Specify which queue C-PAC jobs should be submitted to::

	# Specify the queue to use on an SGE system
	# Only applies when resourceManager = 'SGE'
	queue = 'all.q'

parallelEnvironment
"""""""""""""""""""
Specify which SGI environment to use::

	parallelEnvironment = 'mpi'
