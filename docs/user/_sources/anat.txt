Anatomical Preprocessing
========================

Registration
------------
By default, C-PAC will register brains to the MNI152 template. Users wishing to register to a different template can specify alternative template files in the config file.

Segmentation
------------

C-PAC uses FSL/FEAT to automatically segment the brain into white matter, gray matter, and CSF. This is done by integrating information from the current brain and prior information about the probability that a given voxel is of a particular tissue type. These priors are included by FSL, but must be binarized prior to use by C-PAC.

The following bash script will binarize existing priors::

    # setup what type of priors you want to generate. the example is for gray matter. gray can be substitute to white, csf or brain for priors of white matter, csf and how brian mask.
            tissue=gray
            threshold=0.5
    # copy input from FSL folder
        3dcopy $FSL_DIR/data/standard/tissuepriors/avg152T1_${tissue}.hdr avg152T1_${tissue}.nii.gz
    # using fslmaths to binarize the image at the threshold you set up above
        fslmaths avg152T1_${tissue}.nii.gz -thr $threshold -bin avg152T1_${tissue}_2mm_bin
    # resample the data to the voxel size you want. here I resampled it to 3.0mm isotopic voxel size.
        3dresample -dxyz 3.0 3.0 3.0 -prefix avg152T1_${tissue}_bin_3mm.nii.gz -inset avg152T1_${tissue}_2mm_bin.nii.gz
