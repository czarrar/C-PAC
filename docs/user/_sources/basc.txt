Bootstrap Analysis of Stable Clusters (BASC)
--------------------------------------------

Introduction & Background
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Boostrap Analysis of Stable Clusters (BASC) is a statistical framework that quantifies the stability of Resting State Networks (RSNs) by comparing the results of cluster analysis across replications (Bellec et al. 2010) As it is often impossible or impractical repeat data collection for an experiment multiple times, BASC utilizes bootstrapping to generate a large number of samples from the existing data. BASC can be used to charactarize stable RSNs at both the individual and group levels. 

Computation and Analysis Considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Note: Though they are computed together, it is possible to specify different numbers of bootsraps for individual and group analysis. Additionally, BASC analysis can be limited to ROIs by applying a mask during setup.

**Individual-level BASC:**
#. For each subject, bootstrapping is applied to the original data set. For each bootstrap, subjects multiple time windows are randomly [?] selected from the original timeseries to create a new timeseries of equal length. This results in *B* new timeseries where *B* is the number of bootstraps set by the user.

#. A clustering algorithm is applied to each new timeseries. Clustering partitions the 4D data matrix into *C* clusters such that each voxel timeseries is a member of only one cluster. *C* is the number of clusters specified by the user. This results in *B* adjacency matrices which represent the cluster membership of each voxel.

#. All adjacency matrices are then averaged to form a stability matrix which quantifies the stable features (voxel memberships) across sets.

**Group-level BASC:**
#. Bootstrapping is applied to the individual stability matrices. For each bootstrap, subjects are drawn (with replacement) from the original data set to create *B* new sets, each of which have the same number of subjects at the original. This process is intended to mimic random variations in subject recruitment.

#. Within each new data set, individual stability matrices are averaged to create an average individul stability matrix.

#. A clustering algorithm is applied to each individual stability matrix to generate a group-level adjacency matrix.

#. All group-level adjacency matrices are averaged to create a group stability matrix.

#. The group stability matrix is fed into a clustering algorithm to derive stable clusters. 

The figure below (taken from Garcia-Garcia et al.) shows a visual representation of these steps. For more detail on how C-PAC computes these steps, please see the `BASC section of the developer documentation <http://openconnectome.github.com/C-PAC/docs/developer/workflows/basc.html>`_.

Note that clusters do not by themselves convey any quantitative information regarding stability. Based on a stability matrix, it is possible to construct a stability map for each cluster that will depict the stability of each voxel's membership to that cluster. This can be done at both the individual and group level.

Applications and Recommendations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
BASC has recently been used to investigate differences in striatal organization between children with ADHD and typically developing controls (Garcia-Garcia et al., 2012), and has been shown to have good test-retest reliability (Garcia-Garcia et al., in prep).

A number of parameters can influence the results of a BASC analysis, the most important of which is the number of clusters. Users are directed to Bellec et al. 2010 for an in-depth discussion of how each parameter influences calculation.
