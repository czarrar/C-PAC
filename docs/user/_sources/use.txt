Using C-PAC
===========

Ready Your Data
---------------
Open the :file:`data_config.py` file located in the file:`utils` directory. Follow the instructions inside to specify your directory structure. When you are done, save your changes.

In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you would like to store subject lists for use by C-PAC. Open iPython by typing :command:`ipython`. From the iPython prompt, run :command:`import CPAC`, followed by::

    CPAC.utils.extract_data.run ('/path/to/data_config.py')

This will ouput three files needed to run C-PAC:

* :file:`CPAC_subjectlist.py`
* :file:`template_phenotypic.csv`
* :file:`subject_list_group_analysis.txt`

Configure C-PAC
---------------
Open the :file:`config.py` file located in the :file:`pipeline` directory. This is where you will specify the analyses run by C-PAC and their settings. Follow the instructions inside to set your desired parameters, then save your changes.

Running C-PAC
-------------
In the terminal, navigate to the crash directory you specified in :file:`config.py`. Because of a bug in Nipype, C-PAC will output crash logs from wherever it is run.

Open iPython by typing :command:`ipython`. From the iPython prompt, run :command:`import CPAC`, followed by::

    CPAC.pipeline.cpac_runner.run ('/path/to/config.py', '/path/to/CPAC_subjectlist.py')
