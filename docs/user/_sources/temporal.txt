Temporal Filtering
------------------

Why Filter?
^^^^^^^^^^^
As with smoothing (which is a type of spatial filtering), the goal of temporal filtering is to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. However, whereas smoothing acts to filter unwanted high-frequency noise, most temporal filtering does the opposite, and focuses on removing very slow fluctuations in a timeseries (Ashby, 2011).

Due to the relatively poor temporal resolution of fMRI, timeseries data contain no high-frequency noise. They do, however, often contain very slow frequency fluctuations that may be unrelated to the signal of interest.

How Temporal Filtering Works
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Compared to the Gussian kernel used to smooth spatial data, the temporal filtering method implemented by C-PAC is relatively simple. Users specify a lower and upper bound for a band-pass filter, which then removes any information in frequencies outside the specified frequency band.

Temporal Filtering Guidelines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Though slow changes in magnetic field strength may be responsible for part of the low-frequency signal observed in fMRI timeseries (Smith et al., 1999), recent work in neuroscience has revealed a portion of this signal (sometimes called 1/*f* noise) to be the result of slow oscillations intrinsic to brain activity (Gee et al., 2011; Zuo et al., 2010; Schroeder and Lakatos, 2009). Utilizing measures such as Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF, the power of osccillations (which occur between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz) has been shown to differ both across subjects (Zang et al., 2007) and between conditions (Yan et al., 2009). These fluctuations can also be used to measure functional connectivity within the resting brain (Gee et al., 2010). As these signals may be of interest to some researchers, it is important to take this knowledge into account when deciding on what temporal filtering settings to use. As a general rule, filtering frequencies below 0.0083 Hz seems to work well in most studies (Ashby, 2011).

Other factors contributing to noise in a timeseries are cardiac and respiratory effects, which will often show up as noise around ~0.15 and ~0.34 Hz, respectively (Wager et al., 2007). As these frequencies lie in the region of interest for LFO studies, they can not be filtered out and must be removed later during nuisance signal regression.
