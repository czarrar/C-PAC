Installing C-PAC
================
C-PAC utilizes a number of existing software tools, and these must be installed before running any analysis with C-PAC. Like C-PAC itself, all of the required tools are open-source and free to use for non-commercial purposes.


System Requirements
-------------------


Python
------
Python is the glue that ties all the pieces of C-PAC together. Though many computers come with Python pre-installed, C-PAC relies on a number special-purpose libraries. A complete list of these libraries can be found in the `C-PAC developer documentation <http://INSERT URL HERE.com>`_. 

EPD
^^^
For most users, it is easier to install a pre-compiled Python distribution than to install each library manually. We recommend using the `Enthought Python Distribution <http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php>`_ (EPD). If you are an academic user, you can `download EPD for free <http://www.enthought.com/products/edudownload.php>`_.

AFNI
----
`AFNI <http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/>`_  (which stands for Analysis of Functional NeuroImages) is a set of programs for processing, analyzing and displaying fMRI data. C-PAC uses AFNI for [INSERT SPECIFICS HERE]. AFNI is maintained by the `Scientific and Statistical Computing Core <http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/sscc>`_ at the NIMH.

FSL
---
`FSL <http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/index.html>`_ (which stands for FMRIB Software Library) is a comprehensive library of analysis tools for FMRI, MRI, and DTI brain imaging data. C-PAC uses FSL for [INSERT SPECIFICS HERE]. FSL is maintaned by the is maintained by the `Oxford Center for Functional MRI of the Brain <http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/>`_.
