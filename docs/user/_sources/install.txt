Installing C-PAC
----------------

System Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
C-PAC is designed to run in a Unix-like environment such as Linux or Mac OS X, and thus does not support Windows.

Python
^^^^^^
Python is the glue (Bloom, 2012) that ties all the pieces of C-PAC together. Though many computers come with Python pre-installed, C-PAC relies on a number special-purpose libraries. A complete list of these libraries can be found in the C-PAC developer documentation [ASK DEVS RE: FINDING THIS LIST]

For most users, it is easier to install a pre-compiled Python distribution than to install each library manually. We recommend using the `Enthought Python Distribution <http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php>`_ (EPD). If you are an academic user, you can `download EPD for free <http://www.enthought.com/products/edudownload.php>`_.

`Click here for instructions on how to install EPD <http://www.enthought.com/products/epdgetstart.php>`_.

Nibabel & Nipype
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
C-PAC relies heavily on tools developed as part of the `Neuroimaging in Python (NiPy) <http://nipy.sourceforge.net/nipy/stable/faq/why.html>`_ project. Specifically, Nipype and Nibabel must be installed for C-PAC to run. If you have installed EPD, simply open up a new terminal session and type::

    easy_install nibabel
    easy_install nipype 

This will automatically install both tools. Alernate installation instructions can be found in the `NiPy documentation <http://nipy.sourceforge.net/nipype/users/install.html>`_.

AFNI and FSL
^^^^^^^^^^^^
C-PAC harnesses the power of two leading neuroimaging software packages to perform key analyses. 

* `AFNI <http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/>`_  (which stands for Analysis of Functional NeuroImages) is a set of programs for processing, analyzing and displaying fMRI data (Cox, 2011). `Click here for instructions on how to download and install AFNI <http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/HOWTO/howto/ht00_inst/html/index.shtml>`_.

* `FSL <http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/index.html>`_ (which stands for FMRIB Software Library) is a comprehensive library of analysis tools for FMRI, MRI, and DTI brain imaging data (Jenkinson et al., 2012). `Click here for instructions on how to download and install FSL <http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fsl/downloading.html>`_.

C-PAC
^^^^^
Once you have installed all of the dependencies, simply download C-PAC and place it in the location of your choice. [IS THIS TRUE? DO WE HAVE A PACKAGE TO INSTALL? NOT CLEAR YET]

Editing .bashrc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[DO WE NEED THIS SECTION IF AFNI/FSL INSTRUCTIONS ALREADY HAVE PEOPLE EDITING .BASHRC?]
