Nuisance Correction and Temporal Filtering
------------------------------------------
Nuisance Signal Correction Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
runNuisance
"""""""""""
Set to 1 to run nuisance signal correction, set to 0 to skip::

	# Run nuisance signal correction
	runNuisance = [1]

Corrections
"""""""""""
Select which nuisance signal corrections to apply:

* compcor = CompCor
* wm = White Matter 
* csf = CSF
* gm = Gray Matter
* global = Global Mean Signal
* pc1 = First Principle Component
* motion = Motion
* linear = Linear Trend
* quadratic = Quadratic Trend

::

	# Options are 1 (apply) or 0 (ignore)
	Corrections = [{'compcor' : 1,
	                'wm' : 1,
	                'csf' : 1,

	                'linear' : 1,
	                'quadratic' : 0}]

nComponents
"""""""""""
When using CompCor, set the number of Principle Components to calculate::

	# Number of Principle Components to calculate for CompCor (usually 5 or 6)
	# Only for use when 'compcor' is set to 1
	nComponents = [5]

runMedianAngleCorrection
""""""""""""""""""""""""
Set to 1 to run median angle correction, set to 0 to skip::

	# Run median angle correction
	runMedianAngleCorrection = [0]

targetAngleDeg 
""""""""""""""
Set the target angle for median angle correction::

	# Target angle for median angle correction
	targetAngleDeg = [90]

runScrubbing
""""""""""""
Set to 1 to run scrubbing, set to 0 to skip::

	# Run Scrubbing
	runScrubbing = [1]

runGenerateMotionStatistics
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Required to run scrubbing, but can also be used as regressors in a GLM. Generates FD and DVARS motion statistics as described by Power et al. Set to 1 to run, 0 to skip::

	# Generate FD and DVARS motion statistics
	# Required to run scrubbing, but can also be used as regressors in a GLM
	runGenerateMotionStatistics = [1]

scrubbingThreshold
""""""""""""""""""
Specify maximum acceptable Framewise Displacement (in mm). Any volume with displacement greater than this value will be removed. One volume before and two volumes after each over-threshold volume will also be removed::

	scrubbingThreshold = [0.2]

Temporal Filtering Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
runFrequencyFiltering
"""""""""""""""""""""
Set to 1 to run temporal filtering, set to 0 to skip::

	# Apply Temporal Filtering
	runFrequencyFiltering = [1]

nuisanceBandpassFreq
""""""""""""""""""""
Set the cutoffs for a band-pass filter::

	# First value = Lower bound for a band-pass filter
	# Second value = Upper bound for a band-pass filter
	# To use a high-pass filter, set the second value to NONE
	# To use a low-pass filter, set the first value to NONE
	nuisanceBandpassFreq =[(0.01, 0.1)]
