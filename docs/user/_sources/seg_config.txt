Tissue Segmentation Options
---------------------------
C-PAC uses FSL to automatically distinguish tissue types based on priors. Each prior represents the probability that a given voxel will be of a particular tissue type (white matter, gray matter, or CSF). Priors distributed with FSL must be binarized in order to be used by C-PAC. For information about how to do this, please see :doc:`Anatomical Preprocessing </anat>` section of this User Guide.

prior_path
^^^^^^^^^^
Specify the location of your prior files::

	prior_path = '/path/to/tissuepriors/%s' % standardResolution

Thresholds
^^^^^^^^^^
Set thresholds for use during automatic tissue segmentation. Values correspond to probability thresholds for a given tissue type. For example, setting a value of 0.8 will result in areas with a 80 percent probability of being a particular tissue type to be classified as such::

	cerebralSpinalFluidThreshold = [0.4]

	whiteMatterThreshold = [0.66]

	grayMatterThreshold = [0.2]
