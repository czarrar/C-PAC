Connectivity Measures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
C-PAC provides users a full suite of connectivity measures, including:

* :doc:`Seed-based Correlation Analysis (SCA) </sca>` - Analyze the connectivity between brain regions.
* :doc:`Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) </alff>` - Measure the power of slow fluctuations in brain activity.
* :doc:`Voxel-mirrored Homotopic Connectivity (VMHC) </vmhc>` - Investigate connectivity between hemispheres.
* :doc:`Boostrap Analysis of Stable Clusters (BASC) </basc>` - Quantify the stable characteristics of networks.
* :doc:`Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) </reho>` - Measure the similarity of activity patterns across neighboring voxels.
* :doc:`Network centrality </centrality>` - Analyze the structure of functional networks.
* :doc:`Connectome-wide Association Studies (CWAS) </cwas>` - Explore the examines the relationship between patterns of functional connectivity and phenotypes.

Timeseries Extraction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
C-PAC makes it easy to export timeseries information from your data. Users can choose to extract timeseries from regions of interest, individual voxels, and even surface vertices (requires `FreeSurfer <http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/>`_).

Group Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
C-PAC utilizes the `powerful statistical tools in FSL <http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/feat5/detail.html#higher>`_ to compare findings across groups.
