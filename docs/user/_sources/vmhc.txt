Voxel-Mirrored Homotopic Connectivity (VMHC)
--------------------------------------------

Introduction & Background
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Functional homotopy, the high degree of syncrhony in spontaneous activity between geometrically corresponding interhemispheric (i.e. homotopic) regions, is a key characteristic of the intrinsic functional architecture of the brain (Salvador et al., 2008; Stark et al., 2008). Although homotopic RSFC is observed ubiquitously in the brain, systematic regional regional variation exists (Salvador et al., 2008) and is thought to reflect hemispheric specialization in information processing.

VMHC provides a voxel-wise measure of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between hemispheres (Zuo et al., 2010), and thus functional homotopy. This is done by quantifying the connectivity between each voxel in one hemisphere and its mirrored counterpart in the other.

The schematic above illustrates how VMHC compares mirrored voxels across hemispheres in a symmetrical brain.

Computation and Analysis Considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
VMHC assumes symmetric morphology between hemispheres. As this is assumption does not hold for real brains, images must transformed before VMHC can be calculated. The initial transformation is applied to anatomical data, and consists of averaging an image with its left-right mirrored version to create identical mirrored hemispheres. Functional data is then transformed to fit the new symmetrical anatomical image. VMHC is computed as the resting-state functional connectivity between any pair of symmetric interhemispheric voxels.

For a more detailed description of the way C-PAC computes VMHC, please see the `VMHC section of the developer documentation <http://openconnectome.github.com/C-PAC/docs/developer/workflows/vmhc.html>`_. 

It is worth noting that VMHC is somewhat affected by the level of spatial smothing used. Specifically, smoothing improves the correspondence between homotopic regions and results in greater VMHC strength across subjects. Importantly however, smoothing does not effect the overall pattern of VMHC.

The image above (taken from Zuo et al., 2010) shows differences in VMHC due to smoothing. These differences should be taken into account when comparing studies using VMHC.

Applications and Recommendations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Despite being a relatively new analysis method, a number of studies have already utilized VMHC to investigate group differences in functional homotopy. Kelly et al. (2011) found reduced VMHC between prefrontal regions in patients with cocaine addiction compared to healthy controls, and Zuo and colleagues (2010) were able to chart changing functional homotopy across healthy aging.

Future studies may benefit from using VMHC as an indicator of distrubed functional specialization in patient groups, as well as in longitudinal studies to investigate changes in functional homotopy over time due to treatment, intervention, or development.
