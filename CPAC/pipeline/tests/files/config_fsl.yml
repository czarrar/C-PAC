# Full path to a list of subjects to be included in the model.
# 
# This should be a text file with one subject per line.
# 
# Tip 1: A list in this format contaning all subjects run through CPAC was generated along with the main CPAC subject list (see subject_list_group_analysis.txt).
# 
# TIp 2: An easy way to manually create this file is to copy the subjects column from your Regressor/EV spreadsheet.
subjectListFile :  files/config_fsl.yml

# Full path to a .csv file containing EV information for each subject.
# 
# Tip: A file in this format (containing a single column listing all subjects run through CPAC) was generated along with the main CPAC subject list (see template_phenotypic.csv).
phenotypicFile :  files/phenotypic_file.csv 

# Name of the subjects column in your EV file.
subjectColumn :  subject_id 

# Specify the names of columns in your EV file that you would like to include in this model.
# 
# Column names should be separated by commas and appear exactly as they do in your EV file.
# 
# By clicking the add button on the right, you can also add measure generated by CPAC to the list of EVs
columnsInModel :  ['age', 'MeanFD', 'sitename', 'adhd', 'tdc'] 

# Specify whether each of the EVs in this model should be treated as categorical or continuous.
# 
# To do this, place a 1 (categorical) or 0 (continuous) in the same list position as the corresponding EV.
# 
# For example, if the EVs to include were:
# age, sex, diagnosis, mean_fd
# 
# One might specify:
# 0,1,1,0
categoricalVsDirectional :  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] 

# Specify whether to demean each of the EVs in this model.
# 
# To do this, place a 1 (demean) or 0 (don't demean) in the same list position as the corresponding EV.
# 
# For example, if the EVs to include were:
# age, sex, diagnosis, mean_fd
# 
# One might specify:
# 1,0,0,1
# 
# Note that only continuous EV's should be demeaned.
deMean :  [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] 

# Full path to a .csv file containing contrasts to be applied to this model.
# 
# When specifying EVs in this file:
# 
# - Continuous EVs should appear the same as their corresponding column name in the EV file.
# 
# - Categorical EVs must be split into multiple columns (one for each category), with names of the format EVname__N (e.g. diagnosis__1, diagnosis__2, diagnosis__3)
# 
# If you wish to include F-tests in your model, create a column for each desired F-test, with names in the format f_test_1, f_test_2, etc.
contrastFile :  files/contrasts.csv 

# Specify whether FSL should model the variance for each group separately.
# 
# If this option is enabled, you must specify a grouping variable below.
modelGroupVariancesSeparately :  0 

# The name of the EV that should be used to group subjects when modeling variances.
# 
# If you do not wish to model group variances separately, set this value to None.

# Specify a name for the new model.

# In addition to the standard FSL model files, CPAC will output a .csv containing the subjects and EVs specified above.
# 
# Column names in this file will be the same as in the contrasts file, and will have been demeaned as specified.
